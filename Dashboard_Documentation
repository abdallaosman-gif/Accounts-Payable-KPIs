# Dashboard Documentation ‚Äì Accounts Payable KPIs Dashboard (Q1 2025)

This document provides the **technical overview and build documentation** for the *Accounts Payable KPIs Dashboard ‚Äì Q1 2025 Overview* Power BI report.  
It covers the data source, model design, DAX measures, and visualization logic used to deliver actionable insights into payment efficiency and processing performance.

## üß≠ 1. Project Overview

The **Accounts Payable KPIs Dashboard** provides a consolidated, data-driven view of Q1 2025 payment operations.  
It enables finance teams to track:

- **Payment efficiency** (average time to settle invoices)  
- **On-time vs. late payment performance**  
- **Rejection and reprocessing trends**  

The goal is to improve supplier relationships and operational cash flow visibility.

## üßæ 2. Data Sources

| Source | Description | Format | Refresh Frequency |
|--------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| `Accounts_Payable_Sample.csv` | Consolidated AP transactions for Q1 2025 | CSV | Static snapshot (quarterly) |

**Data Source Location:** `/data/Accounts_Payable_Sample.csv`  

**Extraction Rules Summary:**
- Data is derived from AP payment systems and standardized to include payment date, due date, amount, payment status, and reprocessing info.
- Each row represents a unique **payment transaction**.
- The snapshot captures all Q1 2025 transactions (Jan‚ÄìMar).

## üß© 3. Data Model

**Model Type:** Single-table structure (flat dataset)


There are **no relationships** ‚Äî all DAX calculations reference this single table.

---

## üßÆ 4. DAX Measures

The following measures were created in the `Measures Table` within Power BI.  
Each measure supports one or more visuals in the dashboard.

| **Measure Name** | **DAX Formula** | **Used in Visual / KPI?** | **Purpose** |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Total Volume** | `COUNTROWS('Accounts_Payable_Sample')` | ‚úÖ | Total number of payment transactions in Q1 2025. |
| **Avg Days To Pay** | `AVERAGE('Accounts_Payable_Sample'[Days to Pay])` | ‚úÖ | Calculates average payment processing time. |
| **Avg Days To Reprocess** | `AVERAGE('Accounts_Payable_Sample'[Days to Reprocess])` | ‚ùå | Internal metric used for diagnosing rejected payments. |
| **On Time Payments Ratio** | `DIVIDE([On Time Payments], [Total Payments])` | ‚úÖ | KPI showing share of payments completed on or before due date. |
| **On Time Target** | `0.90` | ‚úÖ | Static target reference for KPI gauge visuals. |
| **Rejected Payments Ratio** | `DIVIDE([Rejected Payments], [Total Payments])` | ‚úÖ | Ratio of payments rejected due to errors. |
| **Rejected Target** | `0.10` | ‚úÖ | Static target for acceptable rejection rate. |
| **Rejection Reason Ratio** | `DIVIDE(COUNTROWS(FILTER('Accounts_Payable_Sample', 'Accounts_Payable_Sample'[Payment Status] = "Rejected by Bank")), [Total Payments])` | ‚ùå | Supporting measure for detailed rejection analysis. |
| **Reprocessed On Time Ratio** | `DIVIDE([Reprocessed On Time], [Reprocessed Total])` | ‚úÖ | Evaluates success rate of reprocessed payments completed on time. |

## üß≠ 5. Measure-to-Visual Mapping

| **Visual / KPI Title** | **Measure(s) Used** | **Page** | **Notes** |
|-------------------------|--------------------|-----------|------------|
| Total Payments | Total Volume | Page 1 | KPI card showing total number of AP transactions. |
| Avg Days to Pay | Avg Days To Pay | Page 1 | KPI card showing average payment cycle time. |
| On-Time Payment % | On Time Payments Ratio, On Time Target | Page 1 | KPI gauge comparing actual vs. target. |
| Rejected Payment % | Rejected Payments Ratio, Rejected Target | Page 1 | KPI card with comparison indicator. |
| Monthly Payments Trend | Total Volume | Page 2 | Line chart showing payment trend by month. |
| Monthly Rejections | Rejected Payments Ratio | Page 2 | Column chart visualizing rejection patterns. |
| Reprocessed On Time % | Reprocessed On Time Ratio | Page 2 | KPI visual for reprocessing efficiency. |
| Slicer: Month | - | Page 2 | User-controlled slicer filtering visuals by month. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è 6. Refresh Logic & Performance

- **Data Refresh Type:** Manual (snapshot-based, not scheduled)  
- **Source File:** CSV file uploaded to Power BI Desktop  
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Calculations centralized in DAX measures (no calculated columns)
  - Simple single-table model ensures fast query performance
  - Static targets used instead of lookup tables for simplicity

---

## üß† 7. Design & UX Notes

- Two-page layout provides a logical split:
  - **Page 1:** Executive summary of key KPIs and quarter-level results.  
  - **Page 2:** Operational monthly trends with interactive filtering.  
- Consistent color palette and layout improve readability.  
- KPI cards placed prominently to support management-level quick insights.  
- Page 2 includes slicers for user-driven exploration of monthly patterns.
